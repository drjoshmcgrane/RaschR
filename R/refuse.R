# rasch :: telling a refusal apart from a fault
# ===========================================================================
# Some analyses cannot be run on some designs, and saying so is a result
# rather than a failure. Residual principal components are undefined when
# item columns share no respondents, because a correlation between them does
# not exist to be decomposed; a factor that defines a frame cannot also be
# tested for differential functioning within that frame, because it takes one
# level among the persons who respond there. Both are conclusions the package
# draws deliberately, and both are worth reading.
#
# A caller cannot tell either apart from a genuine fault when both arrive as
# a bare error. The application showed these considered refusals in the same
# red as a crash, which reads as the package having broken. Signalling them
# with their own condition class lets a caller answer each in the right
# voice, and leaves anything unclassed to be treated as the fault it is.
# ===========================================================================

# Signal a deliberate refusal. Inherits from "error", so an unprepared caller
# still stops and every existing expectation on the message still holds.
